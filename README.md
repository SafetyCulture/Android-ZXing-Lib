Android-ZXing-Lib
=================
This library allows an Android application to use the ZXing library for scaning 1D and 2D barcodes without having to send the user out to the ZXing application.

This library is based on the a Google code project that hasn't been maintained for a while (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-zxinglib/">link</a>), and uses the core decoding library from the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zxing/">ZXing library</a>. Both of these code bases have their own license which at the time of posting is Apache 2.0.
